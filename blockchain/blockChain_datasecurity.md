# Bloackchain based Identity Mangement

"You don't own your data, your data is you". 
Here we will talk about Decentralized identification(DID) and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which are regarded as key technology to achieve SDG 16.9. How can the biometrict integrated identity mangement system can in future evovled into DIDs and SSIs.

## What is Self - Sovereign Identity ? 
here is no consensus on an exact definition of self-sovereign identity yet. It is a concept of individuals or organizations having sole ownership of their digital and analog identities, and control over how their personal data is shared and used. This adds a layer of security and flexibility allowing the identity holder to only reveal the necessary data for any given transaction or interaction. 

**Guiding Principels of SSI** 
1. Existence — Users must have an independent existence.
2. Control — Users must control their identities.
3. Access — Users must have access to their own data
4. Transparency — Systems and algorithms must be transparent.
5. Persistence — Identities must be long-lived.
6. Portability — Information and services about identity must be transportable
7. Interoperability — Identities should be as widely usable as possible.
8. Consent — Users must agree to the use of their identity.
9. Minimization — Disclosure of claims must be minimized
10. Protection — The rights of users must be protected

## What Decentralized Identification (DID)


## What is the role of Blockchain 

## What these technology enables for Public Health ? 

## How proposed system can evolved to become one ?
